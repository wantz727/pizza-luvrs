AWS libcrypto (AWS-LC) is a general-purpose cryptographic library maintained by
the AWS Cryptography team for use with AWS Nitro Enclaves and other AWS applications. 
AWS-LC Ñ–s based on code from the Google BoringSSL project and the OpenSSL project.

## Why AWS-LC?

AWS-LCs goal is to maintain a secure libcrypto that is compatible with software and
applications used at AWS. AWS-LC also serves as the new home for the AWS Cryptography 
team to publish open source contributions and enhancements that are submitted to 
other libcrypto projects.
